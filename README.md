My first github repository to host python code for the K-means algorithms.
Algorithms used can be found in "Information Theory, Inference & Learning Algorithms" by David J.C. Mackay

A number of improvements could be made to this code and repository. Examples include:
9)  Implement Version 2 algorithm
10) Implement Version 3 algorithm
13) Implement the silhouette method

Completed improvements include:
1)  Add a feature to stop 'update loop' once mean values do not move
2)  Reduce the amount of print statements by using loops and a python dictionary\n
3)  Improve the test data so that it contains 5 dimensions
4)  Add option for 2D functionality using an 'if' loop and additional input parameter
5)  Split code into functions which may also easy implementation of elbow method
6)  Copy KerrMeans3D.py and use this to create a soft k-means version
7)  Expand codes to work with more than 3 dimesnions
8)  Implement elbow method
11) Improve the test data so that it contains 10 dimensions
12) Change code to allow automated elbow method
13) Vectorize the distance and update calculation
