My first github repository to host python code for the K-means algorithms.
Algorithms used can be found in "Information Theory, Inference & Learning Algorithms" by David J.C. Mackay

A number of improvements could be made to this code and repository. Examples include:

13) Implement Updated Soft K-means Version 1 algorithm
14) Implement Soft K-means Version 2 algorithm
15) Implement Soft K-means Version 3 algorithm
16) Implement the silhouette method

Completed improvements include:

01) Add a feature to stop 'update loop' once mean values do not move
02) Reduce the amount of print statements by using loops and a python dictionary
03) Expand codes to work with more than 3 dimesnions
04) Add option for 2D functionality using an 'if' loop and additional input parameter
05) Split code into functions which may also easy implementation of elbow method
06) Improve the test data so that it contains 5 dimensions (Moved to OLD_CODE)
07) Implement elbow method
08) Improve the test data so that it contains 10 dimensions (Moved to OLD_CODE)
09) Change code to allow automated elbow method
10) Vectorize the distance and update calculation
11) Add in statistical running capability testing different random number seeds
12) Adhere to PEP8 Python standard
